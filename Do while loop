//Do While Loop: Post-condition check, ensures the body executes at least once. 
The primary difference between while and do while loops in C programming is when the condition is checked and how many times the loop executes

#include <stdio.h> 
int main() { 
int i = 1; 
do { 
printf("%d\n", i); 
i++; 
} while (i <= 5); 
return 0; 
}
