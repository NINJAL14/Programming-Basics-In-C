What is a Structure in C Programming?
A structure in C programming is a user-defined data type that allows you to combine data
items of different kinds. Structures are used to group different types of variables under a
single name for easier handling. It is beneficial for representing complex data entities like
records, such as student or employee information, which may consist of multiple
attributes.

Key Features of Structures:
User-Defined Data Type: Allows combining variables of different types.
Easier Management: Groups related variables for easier management and access.
Memory Efficiency: More efficient memory usage by combining related data.
The following program demonstrates how to use structures to manage information about
multiple students efficiently.

Define a Structure:
The struct Student is defined to store name, roll number, and marks.
MAX_STUDENTS is defined to specify the number of students.

Read and Store Details:
The for loop reads and stores details of each student from the user.
fgets is used to read the name, ensuring spaces are handled correctly.
scanf is used to read the roll number and marks.

Display the Stored Information:
Another for loop is used to display the stored details of each student.


#include <stdio.h>
// Define a structure to hold student information
struct Student {
char name[50];
int rollNumber;
float marks;
};
#define MAX_STUDENTS 3
int main() {
struct Student students[MAX_STUDENTS]; // Array of structures to store multiple
students
int i;

// Read and store details of each student
for (i = 0; i < MAX_STUDENTS; i++) {
printf("Enter details for student %d:\n", i + 1);
printf("Enter name: ");
fgets(students[i].name, sizeof(students[i].name), stdin);
printf("Enter roll number: ");
scanf("%d", &students[i].rollNumber);
printf("Enter marks: ");
scanf("%f", &students[i].marks);
getchar(); // Clear the newline character from the input buffer
}
// Display the stored information
printf("\nStudent Information:\n");
for (i = 0; i < MAX_STUDENTS; i++) {
printf("Details of student %d:\n", i + 1);
printf("Name: %s", students[i].name); // Name contains the newline character
printf("Roll Number: %d\n", students[i].rollNumber);
printf("Marks: %.2f\n", students[i].marks);
}
return 0;
}
