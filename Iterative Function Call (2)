Iterative Function for Fibonacci
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the
two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.
Sequence: F0=0, F1=1, Fn=Fn−1+Fn−2 for n≥2



#include <stdio.h>
void fibonacci_iterative(int n) {
int a = 0, b = 1, next;
for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
printf("%d ", a);
next = a + b;
a = b;
b = next;
}
printf("\n");
}
int main() {
int terms = 10;
printf("Fibonacci sequence up to %d terms:\n", terms);
fibonacci_iterative(terms);
return 0;
}
