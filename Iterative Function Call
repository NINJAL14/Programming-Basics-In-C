Iterative Approach: Uses loops to repeatedly execute a set of instructions. It is generally
more efficient in terms of memory and performance for problems with simple repetitive
structures.
Iterative functions use loops to repeatedly perform a set of instructions until a condition is
met. This approach is efficient and straightforward for problems that involve repetitive
calculations, such as finding the factorial of a number or generating Fibonacci numbers.
Iterative Function for Factorial
The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or
equal to n. The factorial of 0 is defined as 1.
Formula: n!=n×(n−1)×(n−2)×...×1


#include <stdio.h>
int factorial_iterative(int n) {
int result = 1;
for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
result *= i;
}
return result;
}
int main() {
int number = 5;
printf("Factorial of %d: %d\n", number, factorial_iterative(number));
return 0;
}
