Recursive Approach: Uses function calls where the function calls itself with modified
parameters. It is elegant and simple for problems naturally defined in terms of smaller
subproblems, like in the case of factorial and Fibonacci calculations.
Recursive Function for Factorial
The factorial of a non-negative integer nn is the product of all positive integers less than or
equal to nn. The factorial of 0 is defined as 1.
Recursive Formula:

n!=n×(n−1)!n! = n \times (n-1)!

0!=1

#include <stdio.h>
int factorial_recursive(int n) {
if (n <= 1) {
return 1;
} else {
return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1);
}
}

int main() {
int number = 5;
printf("Factorial of %d: %d\n", number, factorial_recursive(number));
return 0;
}
