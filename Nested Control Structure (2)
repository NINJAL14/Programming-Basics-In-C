Continue Statement: 
● The continue statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and jumps to the next iteration of the loop. 
● Skip Iterations: Useful for skipping the rest of the code inside a loop for certain conditions and jumping to the next iteration. 
● Clean Code: Helps to avoid deeply nested if statements, making the code cleaner and easier to read. 
● Efficient Loop Control: Allows precise control over which iterations of the loop are executed and which are skipped, enhancing efficiency. 
● Conditional Execution: Facilitates the execution of loop body only when specific conditions are met, avoiding unnecessary computations. 
● Debugging: Simplifies debugging by skipping over known safe iterations and focusing on problematic cases. 

Continue Statement 


#include <stdio.h> 
int main() { 
int i; 
for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++) { 
if (i % 2 == 0) { 
continue; // Skip the rest of the loop when i is even 
// prints all odd numbers 
} 
printf("%d\n", i); 
} 
return 0; 
}
