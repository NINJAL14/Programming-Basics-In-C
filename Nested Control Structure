Switch Statement: 
● The switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. Each value is called a case, and the variable switched on is checked for each case. 
● In the program, the switch (choice) checks the value of choice and executes the corresponding case block. The break statement is used to exit the switch block. ● Simplifies Multiple Conditions: Makes code easier to read and manage than multiple if-else statements for discrete values. 
● Efficient Execution: Generally faster than a series of if-else statements due to direct jumps to the case labels. 
● Cleaner Code: Organizes code clearly into different cases, improving readability. ● Menu-driven Programs: Ideal for creating menu options and handling user choices. ● State Machines: Useful in designing systems that require switching between the different states based on certain conditions. 
● Command-based Applications: Helps process commands where each command corresponds to a different operation.


#include <stdio.h> 
int main() { 
int choice; 
// Prompt the user to enter a number 
printf("Enter a number (1-3): "); 
scanf("%d", &choice); 
// Switch statement 
switch (choice) { 
case 1: 
printf("You chose option 1.\n"); 
break; // Break statement to exit the switch case 
case 2: 
printf("You chose option 2.\n"); 
break; 
case 3: 
printf("You chose option 3.\n"); 
break; 
default: 
printf("Invalid choice.\n");
