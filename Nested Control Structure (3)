Goto Statement: 
● The goto statement transfers control to the labeled statement within the same function. It is generally discouraged due to its potential to create complex and hard-to-follow code. 
● In the program, goto label; jumps to the label: statement, skipping the line printf("This will be skipped.\n");. 

Goto Statement 

#include <stdio.h> 
int main() { 
// Goto statement 
printf("Using goto statement:\n"); 
goto label; // Jump to the label 
printf("This will be skipped.\n"); 
label: 
printf("Jumped to the label.\n"); 
return 0; 
}
